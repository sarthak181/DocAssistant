Project Method
This REDD+ Methodology Framework document is the basic structure of a modular REDD+
methodology. It provides the generic functionality of the methodology, which frames pre-defined
modules and tools that perform a specific function. It constitutes, together with the modules
and tools it calls upon, a complete REDD+ baseline and monitoring methodology.
The modules and tools called upon in this document are applicable to the following activities:
• Avoiding unplanned deforestation (AUDef)
• Avoiding planned deforestation (APDef)
• Afforestation, reforestation and revegetation activities (ARR)
• Conservation of intact wetlands (CIW), which includes avoiding planned wetland
degradation (APWD) and avoiding unplanned wetland degradation (AUWD)
• Restoring wetland ecosystems (RWE)
The reference to this methodology and the modules used to construct the project-specific
methodology must be given in the project description (PD).
Identification of the VCS-eligible Activity(ies)
To identify the type of VCS-eligible project activity, use the decision trees in Table 1 to Table 3
below. The decision trees must be used to provide a broad indication of likely baseline type and
applicability. Ultimately, the relevant baseline modules (BL-UP – avoiding unplanned
deforestation or wetland degradation; BL-PL – avoiding planned deforestation, planned
degradation, or planned wetland degradation; BL-ARR - land suited for ARR; BL-PEAT – peatland
and BL-TW – tidal wetland) must be applied with relevant applicability conditions and criteria.
Provide all the necessary evidence to demonstrate the type of eligible activity as given in each
module.
7

VYvcs
VM0007, v1.7
A project can include areas subject to different eligible activities (e.g., Area A = avoiding
planned deforestation, Area B = avoiding unplanned deforestation, Area C = reforestation, etc.).
In such cases the areas that are eligible for different categories must be captured by different
strata and clearly delineated (i.e., without spatial overlap), and the procedures outlined below
applied to each of them separately. Projects may be stand-alone REDD, ARR and/or WRC.
Projects may combine WRC with REDD, or WRC with ARR, in a single area, in which case they
must apply concomitantly the procedures for both categories provided in this methodology,
unless, in the case of stand-alone REDD or ARR on wetlands, the expected emissions from the
soil organic carbon pool or change in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario is
deemed de minimis, or, in the case of stand-alone RWE with presence of vegetation, the
expected emissions from the biomass pool or change in the biomass pool in the project
scenario is deemed de minimis. The tool T-SIG or Appendix 1 must be used to justify the
omission of carbon pools and emission sources.
The demonstration of eligibility must be reported in the PD.
Tables 1 and 2 below provide a decision tree for identifying the types of REDD and ARR project
activities eligible under this methodology.
Table 1: Decision Tree for Determining REDD Project Activity Type
Is the forest land expected to be converted to non-forest land or to a managed tree
plantation in the baseline case?

If the project area includes peatland already drained3, or tidal wetlands already degraded4 or
that would be drained or degraded in the baseline case, the project must combine the project
activities identified above with the WRC category, as set out in Table 3 below.

In Table 4 below, the modules and tools are listed, and it is indicated when use of
modules/tools is mandatory, optional or not applicable under each activity type.
Where REDD or ARR project activities take place in combination with WRC, the project must
adhere to both the respective project category modules and the relevant WRC modules. For
example, an AUDD project combined with AUWD on tidal wetland, must follow the instructions
provided in both respective columns.

3 DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS
3.1 Definitions
In addition to the definitions set out in the VCS Program Definitions, the following definitions
apply to this methodology:
Baseline Validity Period
The period of time a baseline is considered valid, as set out in the VCS Standard
Degraded Wetland
A wetland which has been altered by human or natural impact through the impairment of
physical, chemical and/or biological properties, and in which the alteration has resulted in a
reduction of the diversity of wetland-associated species, soil carbon and/or the complexity of
other ecosystem functions which previously existed in the wetland
Expert Judgment
Judgment on methodological choice and choice of input data and to fill gaps in the available
data, to select data from a range of possible values or on uncertainty ranges as established in
the IPCC 2006 Good Practice Guidance. Obtaining well-informed judgments from domain
experts regarding best estimates and uncertainties of inputs to the quantification of emission
reductions is an important aspect in various procedures throughout this methodology. The
guidance provided in Chapter 2, Volume 1 (Approaches to Data Collection) must be used, in
particular, Section 2.2 and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories
Historical Reference Period
A fixed period of time during which factors must be considered in order to make future
projections of deforestation, the duration of which is set out in the VCS Methodology
Requirements
12

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
Organic Soil
Soil with a surface layer of material that has a sufficient depth and percentage of organic
carbon to meet thresholds set by the IPCC (Wetlands supplement) for organic soil. Where used
in this methodology, the term peat is used to refer to organic soil
Terrestrial
On land, in the context of this methodology, though not on a wetland
Tidal Wetland
A subset of wetlands under the influence of the wetting and drying cycles of the tides (e.g.,
marshes, seagrass meadows, tidal forested wetlands and mangroves). Sub-tidal seagrass
meadows are not subject to drying cycles but are still included in this definition
Tidal Wetland Restoration
Reestablishing or improving hydrology, salinity, water quality, sediment supply and/or
vegetation in degraded or converted tidal wetlands. For the purpose of this methodology, this
definition also includes activities that create wetland ecological conditions on uplands under
the influence of sea level rise or activities that convert one wetland type to another or activities
that convert open water to wetland

4 APPLICABILITY CONDITIONS
4.1 General
This REDD+ Methodology Framework is a compilation of modules and tools that together define
the project activity and necessary methodological steps. By choosing the appropriate modules,
a project-specific methodology may be constructed. The justification of the choice of modules
and why they are applicable to the proposed project activity must be given in the PD.
Specific applicability conditions exist for each module and must be met in order for the module
to be used.
Use of this methodology is subject to the following applicability conditions, noting that the
project must also comply with the applicability conditions of the applied modules and tools.
4.2 REDD
4.2.1 All REDD Activity Types
REDD activity types are applicable under the following conditions:
1) Land in the project area has qualified as forest (following the definition used by the
VCS; in addition, see Section 5.1.2) for at least the 10 years prior to the project start
date. Mangrove forests are excluded from any tree height requirement in a forest
definition, as they consist of 95 percent mangrove species, which often do not reach
the same height as other tree species. Mangroves occupy contiguous areas and their
functioning as a forest is independent of tree height.
2) Where land within the project area is peatland or tidal wetlands and emissions from the
SOC pool are deemed significant, the relevant WRC modules (see Table 3) are applied
alongside other relevant modules.
3) Baseline deforestation in the project area falls within either of the following categories:
a) Unplanned deforestation (VCS category AUDef)
b) Planned deforestation (VCS category APDef)
REDD activity types are not applicable under the following condition:
4) Leakage prevention activities include:
14

VYvcs
VM0007, v1.7
a) Flooding agricultural lands to increase production (e.g., rice paddies); and/or
b) Intensifying livestock production through use of feed-lots8 and/or manure
lagoons.9
4.2.2 Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation
Avoiding unplanned deforestation activities are applicable under the following conditions:
5) Baseline agents of deforestation meet all of the following criteria:
a) Clear the land for tree harvesting, settlements, crop production (agriculturalist),
ranching or aquaculture, where such clearing for crop production, ranching or
aquaculture does not amount to large scale industrial agriculture or aquaculture
activities;10
b) Have no documented and uncontested legal right to deforest the land for these
purposes; and
c) Are either residents in the reference region for deforestation (see Section 5.1.2
below) or immigrants.
Under any other condition this methodology must not be used.
Avoiding unplanned deforestation activities are not applicable under the following condition:
6) Post-deforestation land use in the baseline scenario constitutes reforestation.
4.2.3 Avoiding Planned Deforestation
Avoiding planned deforestation activities are applicable under the following condition:
7) Where conversion of forest lands to a deforested condition is legally permitted
4.3 ARR
ARR activities are applicable under the following conditions:
8) The project area is non-forest land or land with degraded forest. 11
8 Feedlots are defined as areas in which naturally grazing animals are confined to an area which produces no feed
and are fed on stored feeds.
9 Anaerobic lagoons that function as receptacles for animal waste flushed from animal pens. Anaerobic organisms
present in the manure and the environment decompose the waste in the lagoon.
10 Small-scale/large-scale agriculture or aquaculture is to be defined and justified by the project.
11 Note that restoring carbon stocks in degraded and managed forests (e.g., enrichment planting) is not an eligible
activity as it falls in the category of improved forest management (IFM). Restoring carbon stocks in degraded but
unmanaged forests is an ARR activity.
15

VYvcs
VM0007, v1.7
9) In strata with drained12 organic soil, ARR activities are combined with rewetting.
ARR activities are not applicable under the following conditions:
10) The project scenario involves the application of nitrogen fertilizers.
11) Where ARR activities enhance peat oxidation. Therefore, on peatland, the project must
include at least some degree of rewetting. In a tidal system where the tidal regime is
restored or continues to be in place, ARR activities are considered not to enhance peat
oxidation.
12) Where project activities on wetlands are excluded by the applicability conditions of
applied modules or tools, such applicability conditions may be disregarded for the
purpose of their use within this methodology, as quantification procedures for peat and
tidal wetland soils are provided in modules BL-PEAT, M-PEAT, BL-TW and M-TW.
Therefore, ARR activities on wetlands are regarded as combined ARR-RWE activities.
4.4 WRC
4.4.1 All WRC Activity Types
WRC activities are not eligible under the following conditions:
13) Project activities lower the water table, unless the project converts open water to tidal
wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters.
14) Changes in hydrology do not result in the accumulation or maintenance of SOC stock,
noting that a) this pertains to projects that intend to sequester carbon through
sedimentation and/or vegetation development and b) this does not pertain to projects
that increase salinity to reduce CH4 emissions. Projects that aim to decrease CH4
emissions through increased salinity must account for any changes in SOC stocks.
15) Hydrological connectivity of the project area with adjacent areas leads to a significant
increase in GHG emissions outside the project area.
16) Project activities include the burning of organic soil.
17) Nitrogen fertilizer(s), such as chemical fertilizer or manure, are applied in the project
area during the project crediting period.
4.4.2 RWE Project Activities
RWE project activities are applicable under the following conditions:
12 This requirement supports mangrove reforestation in the natural habitat. ARR activities located in tidal systems
where the tidal regime is restored or continues to be in place are eligible.
16

VYvcs
VM0007, v1.7
18) Prior to the project start date, the project area meets one of the following criteria:13
a) The project area is free of any land use that may be displaced outside the project
area, as demonstrated by at least one of the following, where relevant:
i)
The project area has been abandoned for two or more years prior to the project
start date; or
ii) Use of the project area for commercial purposes (i.e., trade) is not profitable as
a result of salinity intrusion, market forces or other factors. In addition, timber
harvesting in the baseline scenario within the project area does not occur; or
iii) Degradation of additional wetlands for new agricultural/aquacultural sites
within the country will not occur or is prohibited by enforced law.
OR
b) The area is under a land use that may be displaced outside the project area,
although in such case, baseline emissions from this land use must not be accounted
for, and where degradation of additional wetlands for new agricultural/aquacultural
sites within the country will not occur or is prohibited by enforced law.
OR
c) The area is under land use that will continue at a similar or greater level of service
or production during the project crediting period (e.g., reed or hay harvesting,
collection of fuelwood, subsistence harvesting, commercial fishing).
The project proponent must demonstrate (a), (b) or (c) above, based on verifiable
information such as laws and bylaws, management plans, annual reports, annual
accounts, market studies, government studies or land use planning reports and
documents.
Peatland Rewetting
19) Rewetting drained peatland (RDP) activities occur on project areas that meet the VCS
definition for peatland (see VCS Program Definitions).14
Tidal Wetland Restoration
20) Project activities restoring tidal wetlands include any of the following, or a combination
of the following:
13 These conditions are included to avoid leakage.
14 RDP and CUPP project activities are both subcategories of Restoration of Wetland Ecosystems (RWE) and
Conservation of Intact Wetlands (CIW) of the Wetlands Restoration and Conservation (WRC) project category.
17

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
a) Creating, restoring and/or managing hydrological conditions (e.g., removing tidal
barriers, improving hydrological connectivity, restoring tidal flow to wetlands or
lowering water levels on impounded wetlands)
b) Altering sediment supply (e.g., beneficial use of dredge material or diverting river
sediments to sediment-starved areas)

4.4.3 CIW Project Activities
Conservation of undrained and partially drained peatland (CUPP) activities are applicable under
the following conditions:
21) Activities occur on project areas that meet the VCS definition of peatland (see VCS
Program Definitions).
22) Project activities conserving tidal wetlands include:
a) Protecting at-risk wetlands (e.g., establishing conservation easements,
establishing community supported management agreements, establishing
protective government regulations, and preventing disruption of water and/or
sediment supply to wetland areas)
b) Improving water management on drained wetlands
c) Maintaining or improving water quality for seagrass meadows
d) Recharging sediment to avoid drowning of coastal wetlands
e) Creating accommodation space for wetlands migrating with sea-level rise

Avoiding Unplanned Wetland Degradation (AUWD)
23) Baseline agents of wetland degradation in avoiding unplanned wetland degradation
activities15 meet all of the following criteria:
a) Cause an alteration in the hydrology of the project area (involving drainage,
interrupted sediment supply or both) and/or a loss of soil organic carbon
b) Have no documented and uncontested legal right to degrade the wetland, and
c) Are either residents in the reference region for wetland degradation (see Section
5.1.4 below) or immigrants.
Under any other condition, this methodology is not applicable for avoiding unplanned
wetland degradation activities.
Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD)
24) Conversion of intact or partially altered wetlands to a degraded condition is legally
permitted in the project area in which avoiding planned wetland degradation activities16
will take place.
5 PROJECT BOUNDARY
The following categories of boundaries must be defined:
• The geographic boundaries relevant to the project activity;
• The temporal boundaries;
• The carbon pools that the project will consider; and
• The sources and associated types of greenhouse gas emissions that the project will
affect.
15 That is, not combined with REDD project activities. In combined activities, the applicability conditions for REDD
apply, and those outlined in modules BL-TW and M-TW.

VM0007, v1.7
5.1 Geographical Boundaries
5.1.1 General
The spatial boundaries17 of a project must be clearly defined to facilitate accurate measuring,
monitoring, accounting, and verification of the project’s emissions reductions and removals. The
project activity may contain more than one discrete area of land. When describing physical
project boundaries, the following information must be provided per discrete area:
1) Name of the project area (e.g., compartment number, allotment number, local name)
2) Unique ID for each discrete parcel of land
3) Map(s) of the area in the format required by the VCS Standard
4) Geographic coordinates of each polygon vertex along with the documentation of their
accuracy (from a geo-referenced digital map – data must be provided in the format
specified / required by the VCS)
5) Total land area, and
6) Details of landholder and user rights.
The geographical boundaries of a project are fixed (ex-ante) and cannot change over the
project lifetime (ex post). Where multiple baselines exist (e.g., planned deforestation, unplanned
deforestation, forest degradation, degraded land) there must be no overlap in boundaries
between areas appropriate to each of the baselines. Thus, two project types cannot occur on
the same piece of land, other than those including a WRC component (i.e., combined
REDD+WRC, ARR+WRC).
All land areas registered under any other GHG program must be transparently reported and
excluded from the project area. The exclusion of land in the project area from any other GHG
program must be monitored over time and reported in the monitoring reports.
5.1.2 REDD
The boundary of the REDD activity must be clearly delineated and defined and include only land
qualifying as forest for a minimum of 10 years prior to the project start date. Mangrove forests
are excluded from any tree height requirement in a forest definition, as nearly 100% or all of their
vegetation consists of mangrove species, which often do not reach the same height as other tree
species, and they occupy contiguous areas. Ecologically, their functioning as a forest is
independent of tree height.
In REDD project activities, various kinds of boundaries must be distinguished, depending on the
REDD category (planned or unplanned deforestation, forest degradation), i.e., in case of:
17 For WRC project activities, including subtidal seagrass areas, where relevant.
20

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
1) Avoiding planned deforestation: project area and proxy area(s). Refer to Module BL-PL
for the detailed procedures to define these boundaries.
2) Avoiding unplanned deforestation: project area, reference region, and leakage belt.
Refer to Module BL-UP for definitions and the detailed procedures to define these
boundaries.
These procedures also apply to CIW or combined REDD+CIW project activities, see Section 5.1.4.
Methods for establishing the boundaries of areas subject to leakage from activity shifting are
provided in the following modules:
• For avoiding planned deforestation: Module LK-ASP
• For avoiding unplanned deforestation: Module BL-UP
5.1.3 ARR
The project area must not have been cleared of native ecosystems to create GHG emissions
reductions/removals. Such proof is not required where such clearing took place prior to the 10-
year period prior to the project start date. Areas that do not meet this requirement must be
excluded from the project area.
5.1.4 WRC
The WRC project area must meet the definition as provided in the VCS Standard: “The project
area shall meet an internationally accepted definition of wetland, such as from the IPCC, Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands, those established by law or national policy, or those with broad
agreement in the peer-reviewed scientific literature for specific countries or types of wetlands.
Common wetland types include peatland, salt marsh, tidal freshwater marsh, mangroves, wet
floodplain forests, prairie potholes, and seagrass meadows.”
For RWE project activities, the project area must not have been drained or converted to create
GHG emissions reductions/removals. Such proof is not required where such draining or
conversion took place prior to 1 January 2008. Areas that do not meet this requirement must be
excluded from the project boundary.
The maximum eligible quantity of GHG emission reductions in WRC project activities is limited to
the difference between the remaining SOC stock in the project and baseline scenarios after 100
years. If a significant difference at the 100-years mark cannot be demonstrated, the project area
is not eligible. The assessment must be executed ex-ante using conservative parameters.
Procedures are provided in Module X-STR.
WRC project activities in tidal zones must take into account the effects of sea-level rise on project
boundaries. Procedures are provided in Module X-STR.
21

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
In CIW project activities that are not combined with REDD activities, various types of boundaries
must be distinguished, depending on the CIW category (i.e., planned or unplanned wetland
degradation). For example, in the case of:
1) Avoiding planned wetland degradation (APWD), the project area and proxy area(s) must
be defined. Refer to Module BL-PL for the detailed procedures to define these
boundaries.
2) Avoiding unplanned wetland degradation (AUWD), the project area, reference regions
for wetland degradation, and leakage belt area must be defined. Refer to Module BL-UP
for definitions and the detailed procedures to define these boundaries.
5.2
Temporal Boundaries
The following temporal boundaries must be specified:
5.2.1 Start Date and End Date of the Historical Reference Period
REDD
The historical reference period is the fixed time period during which historical deforestation and
forest degradation is analyzed in the reference region to set the forward-looking baseline, the
duration of which is set out in the VCS Methodology Requirements. At validation, the historical
reference period ends at the start of the crediting period. Once the project has started, and a
baseline update is calculated, the historical reference period ends at the time at which the
baseline is updated.
WRC
While developing WRC baselines, the project must reference a period of at least 10 years in order
to model a spatial trend in drainage, and it must take into account long-term (20-year) average
climate variables, for which procedures are provided in Modules BL-PEAT and BL-TW.
5.2.2 Start Date and End Date of the Project Crediting Period
General
The project crediting period is the period of time for which GHG emission reductions or removals
generated by the project are eligible for crediting with the VCS Program. The project must have a
robust operating plan covering this period.
The project crediting period for AFOLU projects must be between 20 and 100 years. The duration
of the project activity/crediting period must be reported in the PD.
REDD
Projections of baseline emissions must be presented in the PD for the first baseline validity
period (as set out in the VCS Standard) after the project starting date. Emission
22

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
reductions/removals can only be claimed for periods of that duration, for which the baseline is
fixed and a monitoring plan has been implemented.
WRC
Projections of baseline emissions from wetlands must be presented in the PD for the first 10-year
period after the start of the project. Emission reductions/removals can only be claimed for 10-
year periods for which the baseline is fixed and a monitoring plan has been implemented.
Peat Depletion Time (PDT) and Soil Organic Carbon Depletion Time (SDT)
The PDT or SDT for a stratum in the baseline scenario equals the period during which the project
can claim emission reductions from rewetting, restoration, or conservation. Procedures for
determining the PDT or SDT are provided in Module X-STR.
Peat depletion may be accelerated by peat fires and is attained if the peat has disappeared or if a
stable water table inhibits further oxidation of the peat.
Since the PDT and SDT are part of the baseline assessment, they must be reassessed every 10
years.
5.3 Carbon Pools
5.3.1 General
Any significant decreases in carbon stock in the project scenario and any significant increases in
carbon stock in the baseline scenario must be accounted for. In addition, decreases in the
baseline scenario and increases in the project scenario can be accounted for. Where ARR or
REDD activities take place on wetlands, the project must account for expected emissions from
the soil organic carbon pool or change in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario,
unless they are deemed de minimis. The significance of this pool may be determined by using the
tool T-SIG or Appendix 1. Significance of pools must be determined ex-ante or at baseline
reassessment for a specific baseline validity period, as well as at verification for a specific
monitoring period.
Selection of carbon pools and the appropriate justification must be presented in PD and in the
monitoring report (MR).
5.3.2 REDD
The carbon pools (and corresponding methodology modules) included in or excluded from the
boundary of REDD project activities are shown in Table 4.
Harvested wood products and dead wood must be included when they increase more or decrease
less in the baseline than in the project scenario. In all other cases, only aboveground biomass is
mandatory. If a carbon pool is included in the baseline accounting, it must also be included in
project scenario and leakage accounting.
23

VYvcs
VM0007, v1.7
Where the carbon pool in harvested wood products and dead wood increases more or decreases
less in the baseline case than in the project case, the tool T-SIG or Appendix 1 must be used to
determine whether significant. Insignificant pools can always be ignored.
5.3.3 ARR
The carbon pools included in or excluded from the boundary of the ARR component are shown in
Table 5 below. The selection of carbon pools and the appropriate justification must be provided in
the PD.

5.4 Sources of GHG Emissions
5.4.1 General
The project must account for any significant increases in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),
nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) relative to the baseline that are reasonably attributable to
the project activity, with additional guidance provided in Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8.
T-SIG or Appendix 1 may be used to determine whether an emissions source is significant. If a
source is included in the estimation of baseline emissions19, it must also be included in the
calculation of project and leakage emissions.

6 BASELINE SCENARIO
6.1 Determination of the Most Plausible Baseline Scenario
Determination of the most plausible baseline scenario builds on the outcome of the
additionality analysis (Section 7) and must be consistent with the description of the conditions
prior to the project start date. VT0001 must be used to assess the project additionality. The
stepwise approach below must be followed in addition to VT0001 to determine the most
plausible baseline scenario.
Step 1: Reuse the plausible alternative land use scenarios to the REDD project activity that
have been listed as an outcome of Sub-step 1b of the additionality tool VT0001.
Unless it has been demonstrated that any of these land use scenarios are not credible or do
not comply with all mandatory applicable legislation and regulations as required by VT0001
Sub-step 1b, the list of plausible alternative land use scenarios must include at least:
1) Continuation of the pre-project land use;
2) Project activity performed on the land within the project boundary without being registered
as a VCS REDD project; and
3) Activities similar to the proposed project activity on at least part of the land within the
project boundary of the proposed REDD project.

Figure 1: Barrier analysis decision tree
Step 2a: Where the VT0001 barrier analysis is used to demonstrate additionality, apply the
decision tree in Figure 1 to the list of all alternative land use scenarios from Step 1 that are not
prevented by any barrier.
Step 2b: Where the VT0001 investment analysis is used to demonstrate additionality, and if at
least one land use scenario generates financial benefits other than carbon revenues, select the
baseline scenario as below:
1) Where VT0001 Option I is used, the baseline scenario is the land use scenario with the
lowest costs over the crediting period). Option I may only be applied if the alternative
scenarios do not include revenues.
2) Where VT0001 Option II is used, the baseline scenario is the most economically or
financially attractive land use scenario (i.e., the scenario with the most favorable financial
indicator such as internal rate of return).
30

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
3) Where VT0001 Option III is used and none of the alternative land use scenarios have a
financial indicator that meets the benchmark, the baseline scenario is the continuation of
the pre-project land use. Where Option III is used and at least one of the land use scenarios
has a financial indicator that meets the benchmark, the baseline scenario is the scenario
that has the most favorable financial indicator (e.g., internal rate of return, net present
value or cost-benefit ratio).
Step 3: Where barrier analysis is used to demonstrate additionality but does not allow
determination of the baseline scenario, implement one of the following:
1) An investment analysis following VT0001 Option II (regardless of whether it has been used
to demonstrate additionality). Select the most plausible baseline as specified in Step 2b
above; or
2) Through qualitative analysis, estimate the baseline GHG emissions for each alternative land
use scenario that is not prevented by any barrier. The baseline scenario is the land use
scenario that allows for the lowest baseline GHG emissions. Estimates must be based on
publicly available default factors and standards, such as the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for
National GHG Inventories and its 2019 Refinements or the IPCC 2003 Good Practice
Guidelines for LULUCF. All other data used must be publicly available and must come from
recognized, credible sources, such as peer-reviewed literature.
Quantification of GHG emissions under the selected baseline scenario must follow the
applicable and relevant activity-type module(s).
Where project proponents use available data sourced from a jurisdictional baseline that meets
the requirements set out in the VCS JNR Requirements, those data sources may be used under
this methodology, where conservative, even where data accuracy may be less stringent than
required by this methodology.
6.2 Re-assessing the Baseline Scenario
The project baseline must be revised at the frequency set out in the latest version of the VCS
Standard.
The date of the next scheduled revision must be specified. The starting point for the baseline
revision of the project will be the forest cover projected to exist at the end of the baseline
period. Projections for each baseline revision will be subject to independent validation as set
out in the latest version of the VCS Standard.
Reassessments must capture changes in the drivers and/or behavior of agents that cause the
change in land use and/or land management practices and changes in carbon stocks. The new
baseline scenario must be incorporated into revised estimates of baseline emissions. This
baseline reassessment must include the evaluation of the validity of proxies for GHG emissions.
For REDD and WRC project activities, ex-ante baseline projections beyond the baseline validity
period are not required. For this assessment, the historic reference period is extended to
31

7 ADDITIONALITY
7.1 Project Method – All Project Activities Other Than Tidal Wetland
Conservation and Restoration
VT0001 Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality in VCS AFOLU Project
Activities must be used to demonstrate the additionality of the project.
7.2 Activity Method – All Tidal Wetlands Conservation and Restoration
Project Activities
This methodology uses an activity method for the demonstration of additionality of tidal
wetlands conservation and restoration project activities. For such project activities, use ADD-
AM (Demonstration of Additionality of Tidal Wetland Restoration and Conservation Project
Activities).
8 QUANTIFICATION OF ESTIMATED GHG
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND
REMOVALS
8.1 Baseline Emissions
8.1.1 General
Each activity type included in the project must estimate an individual baseline following the
provisions and specific modules mentioned below. Combined activities (i.e., ARR or REDD with a
WRC component) must develop a unique baseline considering peat or tidal wetland soils as the
SOC pool and incorporating the resulting emission estimates to the calculation of emissions and
carbon stock changes of the ARR and/or REDD activities.
The same procedure must be followed ex ante and ex post. For parameters that will be monitored
subsequent to project initiation, guidance is given in the parameter tables of the relevant
modules for the values that must be used in ex-ante calculations.
32

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
8.1.2 REDD
The baseline of the REDD project activity is estimated ex ante. It can be monitored in a reference
area (unplanned deforestation) or proxy area (planned deforestation) for the purpose of
periodically adjusting the baseline. Ex-ante baseline estimations are therefore used in both the
ex-ante and ex-post estimation of net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emission
reductions.
Methods for estimating net baseline carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions are
provided in the following modules:
• For planned deforestation/degradation: Module BL-PL
• For unplanned deforestation: Module BL-UP
8.1.3 ARR
The net GHG removals in the baseline scenario must be estimated using Module BL-ARR.
8.1.4 WRC
Baseline net emissions from the SOC pool must be estimated using Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW,
whichever is relevant (see Table 3). For peat strata within tidal wetlands, Module BL-PEAT must
be used.
Socio-economic processes causing the degradation of wetlands are similar to those causing
deforestation or forest degradation. Therefore, for stand-alone CIW project activities (e.g.,
conservation of salt marshes without a tree biomass component), similar methods for baseline
determination can be used as for REDD project activities. Stand-alone CIW as well as CIW-REDD
project activities use Module BL-TW or BL-PEAT (whichever is relevant) in conjunction with
Module BL-UP or BL-PL (whichever is relevant).
Stand-alone RWE and RWE-ARR project activities must use Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW (whichever
is relevant) for baseline net GHG emissions from the SOC pool. In case fossil fuel combustion is
accounted for, Module E-FFC must be used as well. RWE-ARR project activities must also use
Module BL-ARR for the accounting of biomass and biomass burning (if relevant). RWE-REDD
project activities must use Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW for the estimation of baseline net GHG
emissions from the SOC pool, and Module BL-UP or BL-PL for all other pools and emissions.
8.2
Project Emissions
8.2.1 General
The same procedure must be followed ex ante and ex post. For parameters that will be monitored
subsequent to project initiation, guidance is given in the parameter tables of the relevant

8.2.2 REDD
Methods for estimating net carbon stock changes and GHG emissions in the project scenario are
provided in Module M-REDD.
8.2.3 ARR
The net GHG removals in the project scenario must be estimated using Module M-ARR.
8.2.4 WRC
Net GHG emissions from the SOC pool in the project scenario must be estimated using Module M-
PEAT or M-TW (whichever is relevant). For peat strata within tidal wetlands, Module M-PEAT must
be used.
Stand-alone CIW and CIW-REDD project activities must use Module M-TW or M-PEAT (whichever is
relevant) for the estimation of project net emissions from the SOC pool, and Module M-REDD for
all other pools and emissions (where relevant).
Stand-alone RWE and RWE-ARR project activities must use Module M-PEAT or M-TW (whichever is
relevant) for project net GHG emissions from the SOC pool. Where fossil fuel combustion is
accounted for, Module E-FFC must be used as well. RWE-ARR project activities must also use
Module M-ARR for the accounting of biomass and biomass burning (where relevant). RWE-REDD
project activities must use Module M-PEAT or M-TW (whichever is relevant) for the estimation of
project net emissions from the SOC pool, and Module M-REDD for all other pools and emissions.
8.3
Leakage
Leakage must be considered for all activities, using the following leakage modules:
• For planned deforestation/degradation and planned wetland degradation: Module LK-
ASP
• For unplanned deforestation and unplanned wetland degradation: Module LK-ASU
• For pre-project agricultural or aquacultural activities: Module LK-ARR
• For WRC project activities: Module LK-ECO
For stand-alone CIW project activities, similar methods for leakage determination can be used as
for REDD project activities, and Module LK-ASU, LK-ASP or LK-ME (whichever is relevant) must be
used.
Combined RWE-ARR projects must use Module LK-ASP.
The significance of leakage and the significance of carbon pools must be determined using T-
SIG or Appendix 1.
Where applicable, leakage due to market effects must be considered using Module LK-ME.
Market effects must be considered where the project leads to a decrease in the production of
timber, fuelwood, or charcoal.

Where leakage prevention activities include tree planting, aquacultural intensification,
agricultural intensification, fertilization, fodder production, other measures to enhance cropland
and/or grazing land areas, leakage management zones, or a combination of these, then any
significant increase in GHG emissions associated with these activities must be accounted for,
unless deemed de minimis, as determined using T-SIG or Appendix 1.
Leakage prevention activities may lead to an increase in fossil fuel combustion; however, any
increase in emissions is considered insignificant.
Where leakage prevention leads to a significant increase in the use of fertilizers, Module E-NA
must be used. T-SIG or Appendix 1 must be used to determine significance.
As per the applicability conditions, leakage prevention activities must not include the flooding of
agricultural lands (e.g., for new rice paddies) nor the creation of livestock feedlots and/or manure
lagoons. Leakage prevention must not include the drainage of peatland.
The list of leakage sources with appropriate justification must be presented.
Positive leakage is not accounted for.

8.4.5 Calculation of AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account Contribution
The number of credits to be held in the AFOLU pooled buffer account is determined as a
percentage of the total carbon stock benefits. For REDD project activities, this is equal to the net
emissions in the baseline minus emissions from fossil fuel use and fertilizer use minus the net
emissions in the project case minus emissions from fossil fuels and fertilizer use. Leakage
emissions do not factor into the buffer calculations.
For REDD projects, the calculation of the net change in carbon stocks applied in this methodology
includes an adjustment for emissions from fossil fuel combustion and direct N2O emissions and
excludes emissions from biomass burning. Besides other GHG fluxes, biomass burning involves a
40

VYvcs

carbon stock change. The procedure, therefore, provides a conservative (larger) estimate of the
buffer withholding.
For WRC project activities, the proxy for the net change in carbon stocks applied in this
methodology is NERWRC. As this proxy includes all net GHG emissions reductions, it provides a
conservative (larger) estimate of the buffer.
Since GHG emission reductions from ARR are unlikely to differ greatly from the net change in
carbon stocks, the proxy for the net change in carbon stocks applied in this methodology is
NGRARR. As this proxy includes all GHG emissions reductions and removals, it provides a
conservative (larger) estimate of the buffer withholding.

8.4.6 Uncertainty Analysis
Project must use Module X-UNC to combine uncertainty information and conservative estimates
and produce an overall uncertainty estimate of the total net GHG emission reductions. The
estimated cumulative net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions must be adjusted at each
point in time to account for uncertainty as indicated in Module X-UNC. Module X-UNC calculates
20 The project emissions must be divided between the emissions arising from the respective project areas for
planned and unplanned deforestation.
21 Buffer withholding percentages are based on the project’s overall risk classification, the percentage of carbon
credits generated by the approved project activity that must be deposited into the AFOLU pooled buffer account to
cover non-permanence related project risks. Buffer withholding percentage must be calculated using T-BAR.
Different percentages will likely be calculated for each of the baseline types as relevant.

= Total net GHG emission reductions of the REDD+ project activity up

= Total permanence risk buffer withholding (tCO2e)
The allowable uncertainty under this methodology is +/- 15% of NERREDD+ at the 90% confidence
level. Where this precision level is met, no deduction is necessary:
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅+ = 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 + 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 + 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊.
Where uncertainty exceeds 15% of NERREDD+
(19)
, the deduction must be equal to the amount that the
uncertainty exceeds the allowable level. The adjusted value for NERREDD+ to account for
uncertainty must be calculated as:
Adjusted_NERREDD+

Uncertainty and Quality Management
Quality management procedures are required for the management of data and information,
including the assessment of uncertainty relevant to the project and baseline scenarios. As far as
is practical, uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals
by sinks should be reduced.
To help reduce uncertainties in the accounting of emissions and removals, this methodology
uses, whenever possible, the proven methods from the latest available IPCC guidance documents
(GPG-LULUCF and Reporting Guidelines) and peer-reviewed literature. Despite this, potential
uncertainties still arise from the choice of parameters to be used. Uncertainties arising from input
parameters would result in uncertainties in the estimation of both baseline and project net GHG
emissions – especially when global default factors are used. The project must identify key
parameters that would significantly influence the accuracy of estimates. Local values that are
specific to the project circumstances must then be obtained for these key parameters, whenever
possible. These values must be based on:
• Data from well-referenced peer-reviewed literature or other well-established published
sources22; or
• National inventory data or default factors from IPCC literature that has, whenever
possible and necessary, been checked for consistency against available local data
specific to the project circumstances; or
• In the absence of the above sources of information, expert opinion must be used to
assist with data selection. Experts will often provide a range of data, as well as a most
probable value for the data. The rationale for selecting a particular data value must be
briefly noted.
In choosing key parameters, or making important assumptions based on information that is not
specific to the project circumstances, such as in use of default factors, the project must select
values that will lead to an accurate estimation of net GHG emission reductions, taking into
account uncertainties.
If uncertainty is significant, the project must choose data such that it indisputably tends to under-
estimate, rather than over-estimate, net GHG project benefits.
To ensure that GHG fluxes are estimated in a way that is accurate, verifiable, transparent, and
consistent across measurement periods, the project must establish and document clear standard
22 Typically, citations for sources of data used must include: the report or paper title, publisher, page numbers,
publication date, etc. (or a detailed web address). If web-based reports are cited, hardcopies must be included as
annexes in the PD if there is any likelihood that such reports may not be permanently available.

operating procedures and procedures for ensuring data quality. At a minimum, these procedures
must include:
• Comprehensive documentation of all field measurements carried out in the project area.
This document must be detailed enough to allow replication of sampling in the event of
staff turnover between monitoring periods
• Training procedures for all persons involved in field measurement or data analysis. The
scope and date of all training must be documented
• A protocol for assessing the accuracy of plot measurements using a check cruise and a
plan for correcting the inventory if errors are discovered
• Protocols for assessing data for outliers, transcription errors, and consistency across
measurement periods
• Data sheets must be safely archived for the life of the project. Data stored in electronic
formats must be backed up
Expert judgement
The use of expert judgment for the selection and interpretation of methods, selection of input
data to fill gaps in available data, and selection of data from a range of possible values or
uncertainty ranges, are all well established in the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance. Obtaining
well-informed judgments from domain experts regarding best estimates and uncertainties is an
important aspect in various procedures throughout this methodology. The project proponent must
use the guidance provided in Chapter 2 (Approaches to Data Collection), in particular, Section 2.2
and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance.
Monitoring of Project Implementation
Information must be provided, and recorded, to establish that:
1) The geographic position of the project boundary is recorded for all areas of land. The
geographic coordinates of the project boundary (and any stratification or buffer zones
inside the boundary) are established, recorded and archived. This may be achieved by field
survey (e.g., using GPS), or by using georeferenced spatial data (e.g., maps, GIS datasets,
orthorectified aerial photography or georeferenced remote sensing images).
The above also applies to the recording of strata, including strata resulting from peatland
fires in the project scenario.
2) Commonly accepted principles of land use inventory and management are implemented.
• Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality control/quality assurance
(QA/QC) procedures for inventories including field data collection and data
management must be applied. Use or adaptation of SOPs already applied in
national land use monitoring, or available from published handbooks, or from the
53

VM0007, v1.7
latest IPCC guidance documents (GPG–LULUCF, Reporting Guidelines, is
recommended
• Apply SOPs, especially for actions likely to cause peat disturbances
• The project plan, together with a record of the plan as actually implemented during
the project must be available for validation or verification, as appropriate
For WRC project activities, continued compliance with the applicability conditions of this
methodology must be ensured by monitoring that:
• The water table is not lowered except where the project converts open water to tidal
wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters
• The burning of organic soil as a project activity does not occur
• Peatland fires within the project area do not occur in the project scenario. If they do occur
as non-catastrophic events, they are accounted for by cancelling the Fire Reduction
Premium for the entire project or the individual project activity instance.
• Nitrogen fertilizers are not used within the project area in the project scenario
REDD
For monitoring changes in forest cover and carbon stock changes, the monitoring plan must use
the methods given in Module M-REDD. All relevant parameters from the modules are to be
included in the monitoring plan.
ARR
For monitoring carbon stock changes, the monitoring plan must use the methods given in module
M-ARR. All relevant parameters from the modules are to be included in the monitoring plan.
WRC
For monitoring GHG emissions from peatland or tidal wetlands, the monitoring plan must use the
methods given in Module M-PEAT or M-TW, respectively. All relevant parameters from the
modules are to be included as the SOC pool in the monitoring plan.
9.3.2 Monitoring
Ex-post monitoring must have two key aspects:
• TASK 1. Monitoring according to monitoring plan
• TASK 2. Revising the baseline for future project crediting periods
TASK 1: Monitoring of key variables according to the monitoring plan
54

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
REDD
Information required to periodically reassess the project baseline must be collected during the
entire project crediting period. Key variables to be measured are:
• Changes in forest cover in the Reference Regions for Deforestation (RRD) (at a minimum
of every 10 years), as specified in Module M-REDD and where relevant in Module BL-UP.
• Spatial variable datasets used to model the location of deforestation, as specified in
Module BL-UP. As a minimum, the variables used in the first baseline assessment must
be monitored at the time of the re-assessment to determine if they have changed.
• Where required, carbon stock data, as specified in Module M-REDD.
ARR
Changes in biomass carbon stocks in the project area must be measured before each verification
as part of the monitoring. Methods must be consistent with the methodology given in Module M-
ARR and any technical guidance specified in the monitoring plan.
WRC
In projects with a WRC component, the information required to periodically reassess the project
baseline must include changes in the drainage layout and climate variables, as specified in
Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW and, where relevant, Modules BL-UP and BL-PL and any technical
guidance specified in the monitoring plan.
Carbon stocks in most cases will not have to be monitored during the baseline period, except in
the following cases:
• Where there is an increased accuracy and precision of the ex-ante carbon stock
estimates, which are also used for ex-post calculations. Verifiable evidence must be
provided to VCS verifiers that the accuracy and precision of the carbon stock estimates
have improved, compared to previous estimates. Any change in carbon stock densities
will be subject to validation.
• Where emissions reductions/removals are claimed for avoiding forest degradation
caused by extraction of wood for fuel or charcoal or carbon sequestration in forest land
that would have been deforested in the baseline case. In such cases, the methods
described in Module M-REDD.
Carbon stocks must be reassessed at every baseline revision.
Where emissions are included in the baseline, they must be monitored in the project case,
following the methodological procedures described in the emission modules (E-BPB, E-FFC, and
E-NA).
55

Yvcs
VM0007, v1.7
The calculations of actual carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions must be reported
using transparent procedures.
Changes in water depths in the project area (and leakage belt for unplanned deforestation), must
be measured before each verification as part of the monitoring. Methods must be consistent with
those given in Module M-PEAT or M-TW and any technical guidance specified in the monitoring
plan.
Monitoring of leakage emissions
All significant sources of leakage identified are subject to monitoring, following the procedures
outlined in the monitoring plan. Such procedures must be consistent with the applicable leakage
modules (LK-ASP, LK-ASU, LK-ME, LK-ARR and LK-ECO). All relevant parameters in the leakage
modules must be included in the monitoring plan.
TASK 2: Revising the baseline for future project crediting periods
Baselines must be revised over time because agents, drivers, and underlying causes of
deforestation as well as drainage layouts and climate variables change dynamically. The
methodological procedure used to update the baseline must be the same as used in the first
estimation.

APPENDIX 1: TESTING SIGNIFICANCE OF
GHG EMISSIONS
When a project does not meet the applicability conditions of T-SIG23, the following stepwise procedure
must be used to test the significance of GHG emissions. It is an adaptation of the CDM Tool for testing
the significance of GHG emissions in A/R CDM project activities, v01. The procedure may be used to
justify the omission of pools and GHG sources within the project boundaries, as well as to justify the
omission of GHG emissions resulting from leakage mitigation measures.
The significance of GHG emissions by source and carbon stock changes by pool must be at minimum
tested ex ante to justify the project boundaries and at baseline reassessment. The significance of
leakage GHG emissions must be tested ex ante for the entire baseline validity period and ex post for a
specific monitoring period.
1) Define the period over which the significance will be tested (i.e., either a baseline validity period
for ex ante estimates or a specific monitoring period or annually for ex post estimates).
2) Identify and estimate the following where relevant:
a) GHG emissions by source (per each source) to be included and tested for the specified
period. Estimation must be based on site/project-specific data, scientific peer-reviewed
literature and/or the most recent default emission factors provided by IPCC.
b) GHG emissions attributable to net carbon stock changes by pool (per each pool to be
included and tested). The estimation of net carbon stock changes must follow the
methodology and be consistent with the baseline scenario and project activities.
Estimation must be based on site/project-specific data, scientific peer-reviewed literature
and/or the most recent default emission factors provided by IPCC.
c) Leakage GHG emissions by source attributable to the project leakage mitigation
measures (i.e., net carbon stock changes in above- and belowground tree biomass,
emissions associated with biomass burning and nitrogen application) that the planned
leakage mitigation measures are expected to cause during the fixed baseline period.
Estimation must follow sound procedures consistent with calculation approaches in the
applicable activity-type module(s). Estimation must be based on site/project-specific
data, scientific peer-reviewed literature and/or the most recent default emission factors
provided by IPCC.
3) Where needed, convert the GHG emissions to CO2
e using 100-year global warming potential
(GWP) values from the latest version of the VCS Standard.
4) Calculate the relative contributions of the GHG emissions listed in Step 2a–c above according
to Equation (21):
23 All projects except standalone ARR or RWE projects.

5) Rank the GHG emissions in descending order of their relative contributions RCEi
and order them
according to their ranks (i.e., the lowest emission must get the highest rank and must occupy
the last position in the ordered sequence of leakage emissions).
6) Start calculating the cumulative sum of the relative contributions RCEi
(ordered according to
Step 5), beginning with the lowest rank. Cease the summation when the cumulative sum
reaches the lowest value not less than the threshold of 0.95.
The GHG and project leakage emissions by source excluded from the cumulative sum in Step 6 are
considered insignificant where their total is lower than five percent of net anthropogenic GHG ERRs in
the project area. Otherwise, the procedure described in Step 6 must be continued beyond the threshold
of 0.95 until this condition is met. Even where they are insignificant, project proponents may include
any qualifying sources and sinks in the project case.
For the purposes of testing GHG emissions significance, the net GHG ERRs must be calculated before
discounting the cumulative GHG emissions resulting from leakage.
Significance test calculations must be summarized in the project description or monitoring reports and
detailed in a calculation spreadsheet to be shared with the validation/verification body and Verra.
